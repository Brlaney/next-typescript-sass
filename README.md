# The holy trinity: Next // Typescript // SaSS

This repository contains a basic next.js app that is pre-configured for Typescript and SaSS usage.
The goal of this repository is to create branches/sub-repos/sub-templates? (not sure what the correct term or route is really, but I'll figure it out) that are pre-configured for each frontend styling UI framework that I like using.

## Current UI-styling frameworks on the list: 

- [ ] **Material-Ui**
- [ ] **UiKit**
- [ ] **Chakra-Ui**
- [ ] **Semantic-Ui**
